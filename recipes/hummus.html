    <h3><em>creamy dreamy hummus by yotam ottolenghi</em></h3>
        <p>Hummus has made its appearance in many an Ottolenghi recipe, and for good reason. 
            It is a universally loved food, so much so that it could practically be its own food group. 
            Recently, Noor wrote a little ode to hummus, sharing her tips, tricks and hummus hacks, and was amazed at the response. 
            What seemed like second nature to her was not always the case for others and, 
            all of a sudden, hummus regained its rightful place on the throne of foods-we-need-to-continue-talking-about.

        <strong><em>Go through these steps carefully, pedantic as they may seem, and you will soon be on your way to the creamiest 
                dreamiest hummus that ever did exist.</em> </strong></p>
