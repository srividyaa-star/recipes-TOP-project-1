        <h3><em>perfect vegetable lasagna by deb perelman</em></h3>
        <p>I consider this at its core a classic red sauce and ricotta lasagna recipe, 
            the kind you make for friends and family, the kind you make two of at once so you can freeze the other. 
            If you like your lasagna on the very cheesy side (this is cheesy, but not heavily cheesy), 
            you might increase the mozzarella to 1 1/2 pounds. I buy mozzarella that’s been packaged tightly in plastic, 
            not the kind in water, for baked pastas. For the 4 cups of diced vegetables, use what you can get or what you love. 
            I got about 2 cups from 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms (that I further diced) and 2 cups diced fennel 
            (from a medium bulb). I’d definitely use peppers, zucchini, eggplant, or even broccoli here too.</p>
